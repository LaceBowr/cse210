# Greed
Experience the thrill having gems or rocks fall upon you! <i>Greed</i> might seem easy, but even the best treasure-hunter can end up in the wrong place and get hit by rocks. 

The rules are simple. 
The character can move 
on the screen trying to dodge or hit the falling objects. 
*If your character(#) move connects with a gem(*) you get a +1 to your score.  
*If the character move connects with a rock you get a -1 to your score. 
Play ensues until score is at 0 then GAME OVER appears. 

Live forever improving your score.Try and see if you are the a true treasue-hunter with GREED...
