# Jumper
Experience the thrill of skydiving! <i>Jumper</i> might seem easy but even the best guesser of puzzles can get words wrong with a 26 letter alphabet. 

The rules are simple. 
The guesser suggests a letter between A-Z. 
*If his/her guess is correct you add a letter to the mystery word.  
*If the guess is incorrect then you will see a string is blasted from our skydivers parachute! Oh no! 

Guessing continues until the word is discovered or Jumper falls tragicly.Try and see if you are the genius or the marter for the jumper...
